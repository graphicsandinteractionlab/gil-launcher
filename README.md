# GIL Launcher

This software is a web-based program launcher written in Go. 

## Purpose

We are a [small laboratory](http://graphicsinteractionlab.info) in a university and often asked to run demos for visitors. However, our systems are also used for work and laboratory work. This launcher allows us to go into demo mode within a few seconds per machine and be 'demo-ready'.
